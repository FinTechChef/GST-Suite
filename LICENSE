The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Services and/or Softwares. Each Service will be considered an independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity. In other words, activity in one of the Services is not sufficient to keep your user account in another Service active. In case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be considered inactive.

<h1 id='privacy' align='center'><strong>FinTechChef Privacy Policy</strong></h1>

<h2 align='center'><strong>Summary of our Privacy Policy</strong></h2>


<p align='center'>
This is a summary of our privacy policy which takes effect on March 22nd, 2021. It covers every FinTechChef website and software(s) that links here, and all of the products and services and/or softwares contained on those websites. The <a href='#detailedPrivacyPolicy'>detailed policy</a> follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.<br><br>
Our privacy commitment: FinTechChef has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, and we never will. This policy tells you what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.
</p><br>

## Part I – Information FinTechChef collects and controls

<p align='justify'>
We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account or register your system for Access Permission, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information.<br><br>
When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.<br><br>
Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.
</p><br>

## What we do with your information

<p align='justify'>
We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts and/or unauthorized access to our software(s). We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.<br><br>
We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.<br><br>
You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies from all FinTechChef websites and products.<br> <br>
We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you. <br>     <br>
We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.
</p><br>

## Part II – Information that FinTechChef processes on your behalf

<p align='justify'>
If you handle other people's data using FinTechChef apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing. If you use a FinTechChef mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.<br><br> You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.<br><br> We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use FinTechChef Services and/or Softwares. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.
</p><br>

## Part III – General

<p align='justify'>
There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.<br><br> Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.<br><br> You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums.
</p>

<br><br><br>

<h1 id='detailedPrivacyPolicy' align='center'><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>

<p align='center'>
This Privacy Policy statement is made by the FinTechChef  consisting of all the entities (collectively, "FinTechChef", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 22nd March 2021.
</p><br>

<h2><strong>FinTechChef’s Privacy Commitment</strong></h2>

<p align='justify'>
FinTechChef has worried about customer and user privacy, although it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements.<br><br>
The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.
</p><br>

<h2><strong>Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

<p align='justify'>
This Privacy Policy applies to all FinTechChef websites and/or software(s) that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by FinTechChef through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by FinTechChef on FinTechChef’s online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
</p>
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:<br>
<h3><strong>Part I – Information FinTechChef collects and controls</strong></h3>
<p align='justify'>
This part deals with how FinTechChef collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of FinTechChef's products and services and/or softwares, and others who contact FinTechChef through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.
</p>
<h3><strong>Part II – Information that FinTechChef processes on your behalf</strong></h3>
<p align='justify'>
This part deals with how FinTechChef handles data that you entrust to FinTechChef when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.
</p>
<h3><strong>Part III – General</strong></h3>
<p align='justify'>
This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as FinTechChef's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<br><br>
<h2 align='center'><u><strong>Part I – Information FinTechChef collects and controls</strong></u></h2>
<h3><strong>What information FinTechChef collects</strong></h3>

You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account.

<h3><u>Information entrusted to FinTechChef and purpose</u></h3>
<p align='justify'>
<em>Information provided in connection with services: </em>You may entrust information that you or your organization (“you”) control, to FinTechChef in connection with use of our services or for requesting technical support for our products. This includes information regarding your customers and your employees (if you are a controller) or data that you hold and use on behalf of another person for a specific purpose, such as a customer to whom you provide services (if you are a processor). The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services.<br><br>
<em>Information from mobile devices: </em>When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, call history, contact information, photo library, and other information stored on your mobile device. Our applications require such access to provide their services. Similarly, when you elect to provide access, location-based information is also collected for purposes including, but not limited to, locating nearby contacts or setting location-based reminders. This information will be exclusively shared with our mapping providers and will be used only for mapping user locations. You may disable the mobile applications' access to this information at any time by editing the settings on your mobile device. The data stored on your mobile device and their location information to which the mobile applications have access will be used in the context of the mobile application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless you share it with us).<br><br>
(All the information entrusted to FinTechChef is collectively termed “service data”)

</p>
<h3><u>Push notifications</u></h3>

We ensure that access by our employees to your service data is restricted to specific individuals, and is logged and audited.

We communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the FinTechChef group.<br><br>
<em>Collaborators and other users: </em>Some of our products or services allow you to collaborate with other users or third parties. Initiating collaboration may enable other collaborators to view some or all of your profile information. For example, when you edit a document that you have shared with other persons for collaboration, your name and profile picture will be displayed next to your edits to allow your collaborators to know that you made those edits.<br><br>
<em>Third-party integrations you have enabled: </em>Most of our products and services support integrations with third-party products and services. If you choose to enable any third-party integrations, you may be allowing the third party to access your service information and personal information about you. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the third-party services and products before you enable integrations with them.<br><br>
